"content": "Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a boy named Aryan. He was passionate about running and dreamed of becoming the fastest runner in his town. However, Aryan had one big problem—he had weak legs since birth. Doctors told him he might never be able to run like other kids.\n\nBut Aryan refused to accept defeat. Every morning, he watched his friends race across the fields, imagining himself running alongside them. Despite his physical limitations, he started practicing on his own. At first, he could barely take a few steps without falling, but he didn’t stop.\n\nPeople laughed at him. \"Why are you even trying?\" they mocked. \"You'll never win!\"\n\nBut Aryan ignored them. He trained harder, pushing himself beyond his limits. He fell, got injured, and cried, but he always stood up again. Slowly, his legs became stronger. His persistence started showing results.\n\nYears passed, and Aryan finally entered his village's biggest annual race. The same people who once laughed at him now watched in disbelief. As the race began, Aryan ran with all his might. At first, he was behind, but then something incredible happened—he started overtaking the other runners. With one last push, he crossed the finish line first!\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers. The same people who doubted him now celebrated his victory. Aryan had proved that true strength doesn’t come from the body but from the heart and mind.",
